# Into the Whispering Forest

The trees grow taller and closer together as you step deeper into the forest. Shafts of fading sunlight pierce the canopy, casting shifting patterns on the mossy ground. 

You hear the soft rustle of leaves and the occasional distant snap of a branch, but you see nothing. 

A sense of magic—and danger—lingers in the air.  

> "Every shadow feels alive… I should stay alert," you murmur to yourself, gripping your cloak tighter.

Soon, you spot movement ahead—a fox with golden eyes seems to beckon you toward a hidden path, while a dark cave yawns ominously to your side.
