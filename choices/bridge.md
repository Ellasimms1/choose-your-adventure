# The Rickety Wooden Bridge

You step carefully onto the bridge, testing each plank before committing your weight. The wood groans beneath your feet, but it holds. So far.

Halfway across, the wind picks up, making the bridge sway ever so slightly. 

You move faster.

As you near the far side, something shimmers between the slats — a small metal object,tucked under a plank. You reach down and grab it: it’s a strange old key.

You stuff it in your pocket and hurry the last few steps. When you finally step off the bridge, you realize the forest on this side is quiet — too quiet. Then, you see it.

Ahead,  is a small stone door built into the hillside. No handle, no window — just a single keyhole at its center.

You take out the key.
