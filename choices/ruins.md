# Ancient Ruins

You arrive at crumbling stone walls, overgrown with ivy and glowing faintly in the twilight. 

The air here is charged with a strange energy, and you feel the weight of centuries pressing down on you.  

> "These ruins… they must hold secrets long forgotten," you whisper, awed by the sight.
