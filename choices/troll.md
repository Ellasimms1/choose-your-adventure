# Encounter with the Troll

A massive troll blocks your path, its hulking figure illuminated by the faint glow of crystals embedded in the cave walls. 

Its eyes burn like embers beneath a heavy brow, and its breath reeks of damp stone and decay. 

Moss clings to its rough, gray-green skin, and in its gnarled hand, it grips a club fashioned from an uprooted tree, still tangled with roots.  

The creature lets out a guttural snarl that echoes through the cavern, rattling loose pebbles from the ceiling. 

You can feel the vibration in your chest as it takes a lumbering step forward. 

Despite the terror clawing at your spine, a spark of courage—or foolishness—pushes you to hold your ground.  

> “I need to stay calm… maybe I can outsmart it,” you think, eyes darting toward the narrow tunnels and the faint sound of rushing water nearby.
> Where should you go?
