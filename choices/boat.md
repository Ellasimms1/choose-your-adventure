# The Rowboat 

You untie the boat and push it into the river. Its swaying under your weight. The boat drifts down the river.

But then you feel a sudden jolt, you here a voice nearby.

> " No one crosses my waters"

A tall form arises from the water near the bridge. Its a troll. its now towering over you, your boat is swaying back and forth.

You could reason wirh the troll... or turn the boat around and head back before things get worse.

> What do you do?
