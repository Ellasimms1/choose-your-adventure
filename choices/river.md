#  The Shimmering River

You finally reach the river â€” a wide, fast-moving stretch of water cutting through the heart of the forest. The current is stronger than it looks, and you can hear the roar of it echoing between the trees.

Ahead of you lies a rickety wooden bridge, old and weather-worn. Some of the planks are missing, and others creak just from the wind. It doesnâ€™t look very trustworthy.

A little farther downstream, you spot a small rowboat, loosely tied to a crooked post. It sways gently in the current, as if inviting you aboard â€” but the oar looks cracked, and youâ€™re not sure how deep the river goes.

Orâ€¦ you could turn around and head back into the forest, where the trees close in and shadows stretch long across the path. You passed a fork in the trail earlier â€” maybe thereâ€™s another way around.
