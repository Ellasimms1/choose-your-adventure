# The Dark Cave

The cave mouth yawns before you, damp and shadowed, as if the forest itself has opened a hungry mouth. The smell of earth and something metallic—blood, perhaps?—lingers in the air. Faint drops of water echo somewhere in the distance, their rhythm unsettling in the silence. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you spot faint claw marks along the stone walls and the remnants of bones scattered near the entrance.  

A cold breeze sweeps out from the darkness, carrying a low rumble that vibrates in your chest. Whatever lies within is awake… and aware.  

> “I hope whatever’s in here isn’t angry,” you mutter under your breath, stepping cautiously into the shadows.
