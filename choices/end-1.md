# Rowboat ride back

You have turned around not willing to face the troll.

The curent has picked up now you cant control your boat your are heading right the jagged rocks. You try to jump but its to late. You go under, but you are not alone you try to reach the surface but something pulls you down. 

 You should've kept going.
